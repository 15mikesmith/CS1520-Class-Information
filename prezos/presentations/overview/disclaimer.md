# Course Goals



## Web Servers and Clients

* To understand and be able to program web servers and web clients to accomplish useful tasks
* Web servers are ubiquitous and many / most organizations now have elaborate / interactive web sites


### Server Side Programming 

* These web sites require programming on the server side 
	* Scripts that execute on the server and return resulting documents to the client
	* For server-side scripts we will primarily utilize the PHP language


### Client Side Programming

* These web sites require programming on the client side
	* Scripts that execute locally on a userâ€™s machine via the web browser
	* For client-side scripts we will primarily utilize the Javascript language
	* We will also utilize JQuery, a library of Javascript functions that simplifies much of the client-side programming
	* We may also look at an API, such as Google Maps that can be integrated into our sites


### Client/Server Interaction

* These web sites often require interaction between web servers and web clients
* More and more sites contain resident client code which accesses the server asynchronously and dynamically updates the client page
* We will utilize DOM and AJAX for this interaction
	* Document Object Model
	* Asynchronous Javascript And XML



## Undertanding Various Programming Languages

* To examine and understand the differences in various programming languages, focusing especially on those geared toward Web programming
	* Many programming languages are used for general and Web programming
	* See just the previous few slides for examples
	* How do these languages differ?
	* Why is one better suited to a specific purpose than another?
