## The HyperText Transfer Protocol

* Originally developed by Sir Tim
* HTTP v1.0 standard presented 1996
* HTTP/1.1 standard finalized in 1997
	* Via RFC 2068
	* Though improvements and updates in RFC 2616 (1999) essentially replace RFC 2068 as the definition of HTTP/1.1

## SPDY and HTTP/2.0

* In 2009, Google produced [SPDY](https://developers.google.com/speed/spdy/), another protocol for the transfer of web traffic
	* Doesn't replace HTTP, provides a tunnel for HTTP traffic
* In 2015, HTTP/2.0 standard was finalized
* Based around SPDY
* Google has since deprecated SPDY


Note:
* Why would Google want/need to invent a totally different web protocol?
