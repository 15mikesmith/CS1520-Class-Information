* Expressions that can be generated by regular languages, or that can be produced by a finite automaton

## What Does That Mean?

* Patterns that you can use to match various parts of strings, allowing matches to be made when the exact values to be matched are uncertain
	* Find where email addresses appear in a string of text
	* Check if a string represents a valid phone number

-###-

## Regex in Javascript

* Find a pattern instance in a string
	* `search()`
	* `match()`
* Replace instances of a pattern with other text
	* `replace()`
* Break up the string using the pattern as a boundary
	* `split()`

## Defining Regular Expressions in Javascript

```
new RegExp(pattern[, flags]);

var re = new RegExp("snipe");
```

```
// /pattern/flags;
var re = /snipe/g;
```

-###-

## What will this match?

* `/s*n[iI1]p[eE3]/` will match the following:
	* snipe
	* sssnipe
	* ssssssssssssnIp3
	* sn1p3
	* nIpE

-###-

## The `*`

* This one indicator for matching repeated characters (or classes or patterns)
* `*`
	* Repeated 0 or more times
* `+`
	* Repeated 1 or more times
* `?`
	* Occurs 0 or 1 times
* `{n}`
	* Repeated exactly n times
* `{n, m}`
	* Repeated between n and m times

-###-

## The `[ ]`

* `[]` allows for the creation of character sets
* `[iI1]` matches:
	* `i`
	* `I`
	* `1`
* It does not match:
	* `I1`
	* `iii`
	* `1i`

-###-

## Complement Character Sets

* If a `^` appears as the first character in a character set, that set will match any character **not** listed in the character set.
* `[^iI1]` matches:
	* `q`
	* `7`
	* `T`
* `[^iI1]` does not match:
	* `i`
	* `I`
	* `1`
